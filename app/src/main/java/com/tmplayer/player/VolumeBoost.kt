/**
 * Volume boost and Night mode, one processor: a gain to lift quiet dialogue and a compressor
 * behind it to hold the loud scenes back down, so the explosion that follows a whisper does not
 * wake the house.
 *
 * Volume boost makes everything louder and keeps the peaks from clipping. Night mode ([night])
 * squeezes the range itself: a smaller lift ([NIGHT_GAIN], about 6 dB) and a compressor that
 * starts far lower ([NIGHT_THRESHOLD], about -15 dBFS) at a steeper [NIGHT_RATIO], so a full scale
 * peak lands near -11 dBFS while dialogue at -30 dBFS comes up to -24: the loud moments end up
 * quieter than they were, the quiet ones louder. The two together stack their gains.
 *
 * The gain is [BOOST], about 9 dB. The compressor follows the loudest channel of each frame with a
 * fast attack and a slow release, and above [THRESHOLD] squeezes anything louder at [RATIO] to one,
 * which is what keeps a full scale peak lifted by the gain from clipping: it lands near -4.5 dBFS.
 * A hard limit at full scale catches whatever the attack is too slow for.
 *
 * Even out volume ([level], on unless the viewer turns it off) lifts a track that is quiet as a
 * whole: films are mastered for a cinema, around -24 to -31 LUFS with their dialogue low, where a
 * video made for phones sits near -14, so the same volume setting played the film 10 dB or more
 * quieter. It follows the track's average level (the mean square of its channels over about
 * [LEVEL_SECONDS], with silence left out so a pause does not count as quiet) and lifts it towards
 * [LEVEL_TARGET] (about -18 dBFS), at most [LEVEL_MAX] (about +12 dB), rising slowly and falling
 * fast so it never pumps. It only ever lifts: a track already at that level or louder is left
 * as it is. Its lift goes through the same compressor and limit as the boost, so nothing clips.
 *
 * Always in the chain, so it can be switched while the video plays: the sink's processors are
 * fixed when the player is built. Off, it copies the sound straight through. Switching ramps the
 * gain over [RAMP_SECONDS] rather than jumping, which would click.
 *
 * Handles 16 bit and float PCM, which is what the decoders here hand over. Anything else, and a
 * Dolby or DTS track sent to the receiver untouched, passes it by.
