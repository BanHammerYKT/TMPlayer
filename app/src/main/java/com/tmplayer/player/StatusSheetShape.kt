/**
 * The loading and failure sheet in one of three shapes, chosen by the width it is given.
 *
 * A phone held sideways has around 390dp of height, and the sheet is a poster, a title, a message
 * and up to three buttons: stacked, that overflows and the buttons fall off the bottom of the
 * display. Side by side it is a picture on the left and everything readable on the right, with the
 * buttons in a row under the words. The same phone held upright is the opposite case: beside a
 * 176dp poster the words had about 145dp, the title ran out mid word and a two word button broke
 * over two lines, so there it stacks again, with a smaller poster than a television's and the
 * buttons in a centred row that wraps. A television goes side by side too, at its own size: the
 * large poster and the name on the left, and on the right the message over the buttons in one
 * column, which is the direction a remote moves in. Stacked, as it was until 2026-10-23, a failure
 * with five ways out ran the last of them off the bottom of a 540dp screen while two thirds of
 * its width stood empty.
 *
 * Decided at measure time by [StatusSheet] rather than once at startup: the player chooses its own
 * orientation and is not recreated when it changes, so the screen it was built against is regularly
 * not the screen it ends up on. Kept out of the activity so the render tests draw the sheet in the
 * shape the player gives it.
