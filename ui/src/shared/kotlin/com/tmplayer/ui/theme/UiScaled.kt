/**
 * Draws [content] at the viewer's interface size (CP59): the density is multiplied by
 * [UiScale.factor], so every dp and every sp grows or shrinks together and layouts that measure
 * their space (rows, grids, panels sized from `BoxWithConstraints`) simply find less or more of it.
 *
 * The font scale is passed through untouched. An sp is already a dp times the font scale, so the
 * system's own text size still applies on top of the interface size, once, rather than twice.
 *
 * Always the same provider, even at [UiScale.Default], so changing the size recomposes the tree in
 * place instead of throwing its state away.
