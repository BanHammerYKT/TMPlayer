/**
 * Which files of a listing are one video: the one place that decides it, for the chat's grid
 * ([SeriesShelf]), the copy picker, progress kept per video and search.
 *
 * A file name is a guess, so a name alone never makes two files one video. Something has to back
 * it up:
 * - **The same file.** One Telegram file forwarded into two posts ([MediaItem.fileId]), or the
 *   same name at the same size posted twice.
 * - **Matching lengths.** Within [SAME_LENGTH_SEC], and on the same side of [SHORT_SEC], so a
 *   clip is never a copy of a feature. The length the player learned on an earlier play counts as
 *   much as the one Telegram states (see [group]'s `durationOf`). A length nobody knows is no
 *   evidence either way: never taken for equal.
 * - **A year or an episode code** in the name, with no length to contradict it: "Night Train
 *   (2019) 720p" and "Night Train 2019 1080p" sent as documents (which state no length) are one
 *   film. A tiny file beside a large one, or a short one beside a feature sized one, is still not.
 *
 * What the viewer said by hand wins: a file set apart ([VideoCorrection.separate]) is a video of
 * its own whatever the evidence. Saved data (positions, Watched, corrections) stays keyed per
 * message; this is worked out again whenever a listing is read, so nothing stored depends on it.
