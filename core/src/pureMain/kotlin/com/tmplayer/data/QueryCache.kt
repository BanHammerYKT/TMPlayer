/**
 * A small page cache in the manner of TanStack Query, shared by every screen on every platform, so
 * a page visited before draws at once from what it showed last and is brought up to date behind.
 *
 * - An answer is kept by its [QueryKey] with when it arrived. [peek] hands it back at once, saying
 *   whether it is stale: older than the staleTime the caller gives, or [invalidate]d since.
 * - [fetch] asks once for any number of callers: a second screen asking the same key while the
 *   first request runs waits on that one rather than sending its own. The request runs in this
 *   cache's [scope], so a screen closed half way does not throw away an answer the next visit wants.
 * - [prefetch] is the same at low priority, at most [prefetchLimit] at a time and dropped rather
 *   than queued when that many are already running: a hint, never a backlog.
 * - At most [maxEntries] answers are kept, the least recently used going first, and one nobody has
 *   looked at for [gcTimeMs] goes at the next write.
 *
 * Platform neutral: no locks and no JDK. The table is one immutable map swapped whole with a
 * compare and set ([MutableStateFlow.compareAndSet]), which is safe from any thread on the JVM and
 * costs nothing on the browser's one thread. Every write is a copy of a map of a few dozen entries.
 *
 * What is kept is what Telegram answered, before the app's own rules (size limits, the kids lock,
 * hidden chats): the screens apply those on reading, so a setting changed since is right from the
 * cached copy too.
