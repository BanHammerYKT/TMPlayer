/**
 * Brings a video's first bytes, and the index its demuxer jumps to next ([StreamIndex]), onto the
 * disk before the player asks for them, so the start costs no round trip the viewer waits on.
 *
 * Why: TDLib keeps one download per file, and the player's first request used to go out only once
 * the player existed, after the settings reads and the player build; then an MKV's Cues or an
 * MP4's trailing moov sent the download to the end of the file and back, a round trip each way.
 * Warmed, the head is already here and the index too, and [TdByteWindow] reads the index from the
 * disk without moving the download ([TdByteWindow.awaitBytesAt]).
 *
 * The call to make, from anywhere and as often as wanted (it is cheap, deduplicated and never
 * blocks): `StreamWarmup.warm(item)`, or `StreamWarmup.warm(fileId, sizeBytes)`. Wanted on a
 * press of Play (at once), on a card that has had the focus or the pointer for about 250 ms, on
 * a video page's Play button, and when the next episode card comes up.
 *
 * Then TDLib is left downloading the file from the end of the head with no limit, where playback
 * will read first, for [CONTINUE_MS] or until the player claims it: never idle in the second or
 * two between a press of Play and the player's first request. A video with a saved place (the
 * `startAt` a caller passes: Continue watching, a resumed open) is left downloading from there
 * instead, the byte its seek will read found in the index just fetched ([StreamIndex.offsetAt])
 * or else guessed from the running time ([ResumeWindow]): the head and the index still come
 * first, and the place is asked for only once they are here. A warm-up that gives way (to a
 * newer one, or to a play of another file) or runs out cancels its download, so a card the focus
 * passed over does not keep the line busy. While a video plays, a warm-up (of the next episode)
 * brings the head and the index only.
 *
 * Never in the player's way: a player that opens the file claims it ([claim]), and from then on
 * nothing is asked of TDLib here; claim and request are serialised, so the player's own request
 * is always the last word. A claim also stops the warm-ups of every other file, which would share
 * the line with the stream. Skipped for a file already whole, one the viewer is downloading (that
 * download is not to be moved), a cut video's pieces or a film in parts, and wherever [allowed]
 * says no ("Save mobile data" on a metered line).
 *
 * In Low storage mode ([lowStorage]) only the head and the index come, a few megabytes that the
 * mode's window counts once the player finds them ([LowStorageStreams.onDisk]): no download is
 * left running after them, no resumed place is fetched, and a file that had nothing on the disk
 * before and is not played within [LOW_STORAGE_KEEP_MS] is deleted again, so a card the focus
 * passed over leaves nothing behind. Without them the player waited on Telegram for the index at
 * the far end of the file and then for the way back, which is most of why a start in that mode
 * took so much longer.
